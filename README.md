🔍 Overview

This document introduces a novel concept in superconductivity research involving the intentional pairing of diamagnetic and paramagnetic materials in a metallic coil geometry. The theoretical model explores how opposing magnetic susceptibilities (diamagnetic vs. paramagnetic) can induce a stationary spinning magnetic field when bonded or layered, possibly resulting in levitation effects, alternating magnetic fields, and static-field-based superconductive conditions.

🧠 Core Theory

Diamagnetic + Paramagnetic materials behave like opposing poles in a magnet.

When combined with a metallic conductor and shaped into a coil, the system may act like a spinning magnet without mechanical rotation.

This may result in:

A pseudo-alternating magnetic field without requiring alternating current.

Field expulsion effects similar to the Meissner Effect in superconductors.

Enhanced conditions for Cooper pair formation due to field resonance and static alignment.

Potential levitation or magnetic field locking behaviors.

🔌 Application Hypothesis

If a voltage is applied to this type of coil:

The system may develop a self-sustaining alternating field structure.

The field interaction could mimic superconductive behavior even at room temperature.

The magnetic bubble (or "shield") created may lead to diamagnetic levitation, material stabilization, or energy-efficient magnetic control.

📦 Materials Considered

Examples of alloy pairs mentioned:

Nichrome (Ni + Cr) – Nickel (ferromagnetic), Chromium (antiferromagnetic)

FeCrAl – Iron (ferromagnetic), Chromium (antiferromagnetic), Aluminum (paramagnetic)


What’s missing from current commercial alloys: a diamagnetic-paramagnetic opposition pairing in one engineered coil — the heart of this concept.

🔧 Next Steps (Experimental Suggestions)

Fabricate a hybrid coil using a diamagnetic core (like copper) electroplated with a paramagnetic layer (like aluminum or manganese).

Apply voltage and monitor for field resonance, temperature drop, and levitation forces.

Track magnetic field polarity and switching behavior with Hall sensors or fluxgate probes.
